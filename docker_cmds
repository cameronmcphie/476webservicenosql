To start a single instance of ScyllaDB, use the following command (entered all on one line):
    $ docker run --name scylla -d scylladb/scylla --smp 1 --memory 1G --overprovisioned 1 --developer-mode 1 --experimental 1

Wait a few moments, then check that ScyllaDB is up with
    $ docker exec -it scylla nodetool status

If this command fails, you can check for errors in the ScyllaDB logs by running
    $ docker logs scylla

Once ScyllaDB is up, you can execute CQL commands using
    $ docker exec -it scylla cqlsh

If you need to stop ScyllaDB, use
    $ docker stop scylla

and restart with
    $ docker start scylla

You can remove ScyllaDB completely and start over with
    $ docker rm -f scylla && docker rmi scylladb/scylla


Once the docker instance of ScyllaDB is up and running just run the statements in test.cql
